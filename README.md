# Star  Wars RPG

# Objective
The objective of this game is to, using a single character, 

# Step 1
Click on the character you wish to use.

# Step 2 
Click on the enemy you wish to fight in the foes tab. They should move to the defender area and the attack button will light up signaling you can use it.

Clicking the attack button will reduce their health (the number displayed beneath the character) by your attack value. If they still stand after your attack they will counter attack dealing damage and reducing your health as well. 

Attacking enemies gradually increases your fighter's attack value so it is key that you choose your opponents well so that you don't become exhausted.

# Step 3

After you defeat your first foe, keep doing step 2 until you either lose all your HP or you defeat all opposition.
